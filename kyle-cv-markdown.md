## Summary

I am a passionate, highly motivated Software Engineer who likes to write self-documenting, clean code. A self-starter who loves to learn, I have a broad range of skills with specific focus around the Java ecosystem. I&#x27;ll never stop asking why things are done and how they can be made better. I am looking for a team who share my enthusiasm for quality, who aren&#x27;t afraid to move fast and break things and, most importantly, enjoy what they do.
